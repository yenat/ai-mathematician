"""Phase 1 Search: given a goal, rank the facts available before it.

Deterministic, no LLM. Two signals, combined:

  1. Symbol overlap (in the spirit of Sledgehammer's MePo filter): a fact is
     relevant if it mentions the goal's constants, weighted by how rare each
     constant is -- sharing `SNoLev` says much more than sharing `and`.

  2. Learned from earlier proofs (in the spirit of MaSh k-NN): find earlier
     theorems whose statements resemble the goal, and vote for the facts
     THEIR proofs actually cited. Trained strictly on theorems before the
     goal, so the goal's own proof is never seen.

  3. Recency: 23% of the facts real proofs cite were proved within the 30
     declarations before the goal. In the agent setting this corresponds to
     "lemmas just proved" -- the Phase 2 working-memory idea -- so it is a
     legitimate signal, not an artifact of the benchmark.

Deliberately OFF by default: similarity to the goal's human-chosen NAME
(`name_w`). It adds ~2-3 points of recall here, but a genuinely new lemma
the system conjectures won't come with a descriptive human name, so using
it would inflate the benchmark relative to real use.

Leak discipline: `rank(goal_index, ...)` only ever considers declarations
with index < goal_index.
